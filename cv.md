## ABOUT:
*Almost all my life I've been trying to find myself, to find my way. I never know who I want to be. But one thing that I know I want to be free. To be free to discover new countries with it's people & culture, to be free to tell what I want.
And now I understand I want to be a front-end developer! Now I start my new way.*
